Elon Musk gave a presentation last week about SpaceX's [plans to start a self-sustaining colony on Mars](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/27/13079382/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony-plans). Here is [a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qo78R_yYFA), and the [full presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10gECHeMSds), and also an article with what seem like [some sensible improvements to the plan](http://jalopnik.com/heres-how-to-fix-the-big-problems-with-elon-musks-mars-1787163420).

Video explainer of [why time doesn't flow backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKbJ9leUNDE), featuring Sean Carroll. 

[Viral NYT book review](https://twitter.com/MarkHarrisNYC/status/781202393509818368) of "Hitler". And a [Vox explainer](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/29/13093316/hitler-trump-review) of it.

"Rare image of a shark stepping on a Lego."

80% of data in Chinese clinical trials for new pharmaceuticals [have been fabricated](http://www.sciencealert.com/80-of-the-data-in-chinese-clinical-trial-is-fabricated), according to a Chinese government report.

Long, interesting article about [working and doing business in Japan](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/), in particular being a salaryman. The opening:

"The Company Is Father. The Company Is Mother.

The slice of contemporary Japanese life of keenest interest to you is dominated by one particular relationship: that of the Japanese salaryman to his employer. If you understand this relationship, it is almost a Rosetta stone. You’ll immediately be able to predict true things about the world like "Japanese startups probably have huge difficulties in hiring." (About which, more later.)"

[Spider silk dress](https://twitter.com/JanFreedman/status/782952628011622400). And a quote from [the article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2016/oct/03/cobweb-silk-science-technology-spider-thread):

"In looking for the answer to the question of producing spider silk in sufficient quantities, we have lately turned to genetically modified [spider-goats](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/20/martinkettle) – no less fantastical but certainly real. Nevertheless, despite the fact that these goats can be milked (or silked?) for the right proteins, no one has yet produced from this a material that can match the strength and elasticity of the real thing."

Disappointingly, the spider-goat link is from 2000, so it seems this has not become our new reality. Maybe CRISPR will speed things up??

If you are interested in a *very* long, spider-related web serial, I would recommend [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/).
