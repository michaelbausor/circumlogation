Just watched the 1st presidential debate. Betting markets [scored it a win for Clinton](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/upshot/prediction-markets-score-it-a-rout-clinton-over-trump.html), although that seems far from certain.

Completely unrelatedly - [the Libertarian Party platform](https://www.lp.org/platform) is short and quite interesting reading. Paul Krugman strongly criticized it in a recent [plea to young voters](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/opinion/vote-as-if-it-matters.html), and [Tyler Cowen responded here](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/09/paul-krugman-gary-johnson-libertarianism-pollution.html). The points about the environment are (I think) the most interesting:

Krugman:

"What really struck me, however, was what the platform says about the environment. It opposes any kind of regulation; instead, it argues that we can rely on the courts. Is a giant corporation poisoning the air you breathe or the water you drink? Just sue: "Where damages can be proven and quantified in a court of law, restitution to the injured parties must be required." Ordinary citizens against teams of high-priced corporate lawyers — what could go wrong?"

Cowen:

"That is the opposite of the correct criticism.  The main problem with classical libertarianism is that it doesn’t allow *enough* pollution.  Under libertarian theory, pollution is a form of violent aggression that should be banned...Historically, under the more limited government of the 19th century, it was big business that wanted to move away from unpredictable local and litigation-driven methods of control, and toward a more systematic regulatory approach at the national level."

I think Tyler's argument, while (perhaps?) historically true, doesn't fit at all with how a real-world repeal of environmental regulation would work out. Even the best-case scenario for that sort of plan seems like it would be (as Tyler suggests it was) highly unpredictable. Some forms of pollution would be completely stopped (because legal precedent allowed individuals to win cases) while others would be completely unrestricted (because legal precedent (or lack thereof) made winning cases impossible or very costly).

Google Deepmind has created [a generative model for raw audio](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/). 

"...WaveNets are able to generate speech which mimics any human voice and which sounds more natural than the best existing Text-to-Speech systems, reducing the gap with human performance by over 50%."

The article is interesting, or else skip to about 2/3 of the way down to the audio clips (in English and Mandarin) which are quite impressive. It also generates other audio, including what sounds like piano music - [here are some comments](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/09/23/learning-music-from-learned-music/) from a musician and researcher for Google Brain.

Monsanto has [licensed the use of CRISPR](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/monsanto-nets-first-crispr-license-to-modify-crops-with-key-restrictions/) from the Broad Institute for use in seed development, but with a restriction specifically preventing the use of a gene drive. There was also this, which I didn't know:

"The Broad also stipulated that Monsanto not use CRISPR-Cas9 to create sterile ("terminator") seeds...No such crops have been commercially deployed"

I thought that selling sterile seeds was standard practice for Monsanto and others, but [it turns out that isn't the case](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted).

Important [good news story from the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/opinion/the-best-news-you-dont-know.html) that is easy to forget:
