The Washington Post makes history, [calling for the imprisonment of its own
source](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/18
/washpost-makes-history-first-paper-to-call-for-prosecution-of-its-own-source-
after-accepting-
pulitzer/).
The source is question is [Edward
Snowden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions
/edward-snowden-doesnt-deserve-a-pardon/2016/09/17/ec04d448-7c2e-11e6-ac8e-
cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html), and WaPo won a Pulitzer for its reporting of the
information he leaked.

From the first article:

"After denouncing their own paper's PRISM revelation, the editors proclaim:
"Worse -- far worse -- he also leaked details of basically defensible
international intelligence operations." But what they inexcusably omit is that
it was not Edward Snowden, but the top editors of the Washington Post who
decided to make these programs public."

And:

"...this highlights a chronic cowardice that often arises when establishment
figures want to denounce Snowden. As has been amply documented... Snowden
himself played no role in deciding which... programs would be exposed... he
left it to the newspapers to decide which revelations would and would not
serve the public interest."

Compare against Wikileaks, who [last month published medical
records](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/23
/wikileaks-posts-sensitive-medical-information-saudi-
arabia) of
hundreds of ordinary people.

this is real or faked. And Tyler Cowen discusses the [morality of leaking the

[Someone is learning how to take down the
internet](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/09/someone_is_lear.html),
from Bruce Schneier. The article is light on specifics, referring to unnamed
companies that spoke to Schneier in confidence For those not familiar with
him, Schneier is a very credible source on matters of security.

More from Schneier - [cracking bridge hand
