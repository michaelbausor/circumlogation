[Mother Jones article on
journalism](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2016/08
/whats-missing-from-
journalism),
in the wake of their [long investigative piece on private
prisons](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06
/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-
bauer). Key
quote:

"Conservatively, counting just the biggest chunks of staff time that went into
it, the prison story cost roughly $350,000. The banner ads that appeared on
the article brought in $5,000, give or take. Had we been really in your face
with ads, we could have doubled or tripled that figure--but it would have been
a pain for you, and still only a drop in the bucket for us."

"To adapt a line from a Coen brothers
[classic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/trivia?tab%3Dqt%26ref_%3Dtt_trv_qu):
Say what you will about the tenets of Marxism, Dude, at least it's a formal
attempt to direct capital to achieve a desired end."

EpiPens have been in the news in the US, with the price having risen by 400%
since 2007. As with so many things, I agree with [Scott Alexander's take on
the subject](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29
/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/). In defense of [the Vox
take](http://www.vox.com/2016/8/23/12608316
/epipen-price-
mylan) which
Scott criticizes, it does seem like the US health care system is in a worst-
of-both-worlds system in which they don't have a functioning market in
pharmaceuticals to keep prices low, but also don't have strong government
price controls like most western countries, meaning that when conditions are
right, companies can price gouge. One thing that seems like a good step for
just about all developed nations would be [reciprocal
