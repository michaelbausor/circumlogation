Extract of a l[ecture given by Waleed Aly](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/meet-the-the-fastfeeler-a-creature-who-explains-little-but-emotes-quickly-20161014-gs29kq.html) (the Andrew Olle Media Lecture) on the changing nature of media and news - long and interesting.

"Technology is never value-neutral. It might allow us to do things we already do more easily. It may offer us new ways of delivering the same service. But it never does merely that... So it is simply naive in my view to assume that as the platforms for journalism change, that the very idea of journalism itself will be somehow remain unaffected; that whether we're talking about a printed newspaper, a broadcast news bulletin or a website, that we're merely talking about different platforms for delivering the same content. We're not."

Computer scientists have [discovered an algorithm for fairly dividing a cake](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20161006-new-algorithm-solves-cake-cutting-problem/) (or anything else) between any number of people - although not particularly quickly as yet:

"The algorithm is extraordinarily complex: Dividing a cake among n players can require as many as n^n^n^n^n^n steps and a roughly equivalent number of cuts."

On the [psychological phenomenon of Ra](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/ra/).

"A new demon, if you will, in the grimoire that includes [Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) and [Azathoth](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/)."

"Ra promotes the idea that optimal politeness conveys as little information as possible... There’s an interpretation of "politeness" that’s anti-cooperative, that avoids probing for opportunities for genuine mutual benefit or connection and just wants to make the mutual defection process go as smoothly as possible."

(The articles on Moloch and Azathoth are also worth reading.)
