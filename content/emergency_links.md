[SlateStarCodex has a great pre-election perspective](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/07/tuesday-shouldnt-change-the-narrative/), looks even better after we know the result.

Nate SIlver -[ what a different two percentage points makes](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-a-difference-2-percentage-points-makes/).

"National polls will eventually miss the popular vote by about 2 percentage points, which is right in line with the historical average (and, actually, a bit *better* than national polls did in 2012). State polls had considerably more problems, underestimating Clintonâ€™s complete collapse of support among white voters without college degrees but *also underestimating* her support in states that have large Hispanic populations, such as New Mexico."
