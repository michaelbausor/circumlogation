[Long interview with Charles
Koch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/01/i
-dont-like-the-idea-of-capitalism-charles-koch-
unfiltered/).
In my normal reading, he is usually referenced in an offhanded way as a
comically evil figure, so I found the interview quite interesting mainly
because (as is always the case) it turns out there is more to him than that
caricature.

I also discovered in the interview that Koch funds the Mercatus Center, which
I am familiar with because of Tyler Cowen's great interview series
[Conversations With
Tyler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list

...which lets me transition into what the hell is the deal with Peter Thiel.
He is:

  * Cofounder of Paypal, along with Elon Musk
  * Early investor in Facebook, making him a billionaire
  * Author of [Zero to One](https://smile.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296), which I enjoyed (and gives him a [snappy twitter feed](https://twitter.com/peterthiel))
  * Funder of the [Seasteading Institute](http://www.seasteading.org/)
  * Funder of [Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker, seemingly out of revenge](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html)
  * A Trump delegate ([here is his convention speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DP2cemLrzpr4))
  * [Possibly a vampire??](http://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html)

[World bank quote of the
week](http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/node/7468):

"Any good political psychologist should have the moral and historical
imagination to see how he or she could become almost any ideological creature
that has existed, or does exist on the planet. That includes Nazis,
Stalinists, Maoists, Isil â€¦ There but for the grace of God."

I was going to link here about how Trump kicked a baby out of one of his
events, but it turns out he was [probably taken out of
context](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news
