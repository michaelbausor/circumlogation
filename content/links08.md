who are building a desktop environment for VR. You can try their beta now! I
feel like it not going to be long before a VR desktop environment will be very
normal for people who use their computer a lot (at work or at home),
especially as the technology is improving very fast, and the ability for
customization and control in a VR space is awesome.

"...indeed, it is a monumental task. Case in point, consider the Netherlands.
They are one of the most prominent advocates of open access in Europe, and
until very recently, their official target to reach full open access for Dutch
scientific papers was set at 2024."

up](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/07/reverse-
voxsplaining-brand-name-
drugs/). Once
again, the Slate Star Codex article is really worth reading. It hones in on a
key point - the difference between generic drugs, and drugs under patent:

"Generic drugs are overpriced because we're morons who can't come up with a
decent regulatory regime. Brand-name drugs are overpriced because of a
deliberate decision to overprice them to encourage research."
