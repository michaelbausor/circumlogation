Computer security is super hard. You may have heard about
[heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed),
a bug found in 2014 in an open source SSL library which affected approximately
17% of secure servers on the internet. But there are other interesting
categories of obscure vulnerabilities which focus on hardware or other non-
standard avenues of attack. These aren't as practical or important as things
like heartbleed, but they are pretty interesting:

  * [Gaining privileged access](http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html) on a machine using the rowhammer bug in DRAM, in which an attacker rapidly flips particular bits in memory (to which they have access), causing other "victim" bits (to which they are not supposed to have access) to be flipped.
  *   * [A microchip fabrication-time attack](https://plus.sandbox.google.com/%2BYonatanZunger/posts/ayXVWrFpQus), in which adding a single logic gate in just the right empty space on the chip can be used to run CPU instructions in supervisor mode (i.e. with the same privileges as the operating system)
  * [The Ken Thompson Hack](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack), in which a compromised compiler will inject malicious binary code into programs when it compiles them, including whenever it is used to compile its own source code. This means that once bootstrapped into the compiler, the malicious binary code can propagate without ever appearing in human readable source code at all.
  * [Breaking 4096-bit RSA by listening](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/) to the computer. Like, with a microphone.
  * I'm sure there are tons I haven't heard of...

vision systems. I would like to write down my thoughts, but I don't have them
sufficiently gathered and I want to send this tonight.

"...what they found is that AR Sco is not a simple star at all. It's a binary,
with one of the stars being the corpse of a normal star. And not only that,
the corpse is feisty, and well-armed: It's zapping the other star with the
stellar equivalent of a death ray.

[Divorce may be less
common](https://www.good.is/articles/divorce-

than is commonly thought, and there is seemingly a big gap based on eduction:

"...only 11 percent of college-educated people who tied the knot in the early
2000s split up before their seventh year of marriage, while 17 percent of less
educated couples got divorced."
